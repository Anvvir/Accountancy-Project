				This is the anthem
				Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
				Two girls that's a tandem
				She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
				Got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
				This shit is not random (Nope)
				Everybody ain't got it, understand son (Sorry)
				This shit is not random

				Now imagine it, put the hours in and stay passionate
				Wasn't blowing money, I was stacking it
				Figured what the fuck I want to do in life and practiced it
				Pay attention, none of this is happening by accident
				Listen, I don't slack a bit
				Game plan solid, no cracks in it
				Said I want a billion now nothing less is adequate
				Grab and check, cashing it
				I was born addicted to the money
				Difference is now if finally found a way to manage it
				What you think I'm paid for nothing?
				You must be mistaken someone
				I had to go make that fund and I'm trying to be great at something
				Spend not saving nothing
				Flying from the bay to London
				They say that money talks but you're not saying nothing
				Now try and shade me, I'm like I guess
				Why yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex
				Sign CDs and I sign breasts
				Understand, to these female fans, I'm sex
				Listen
				<br><br>
				It's my world and I do what I like to
				I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
				If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you
				'Cause I got what they got I am talking times two
				Disagree with me and you’ve been lied to
				I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
				Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
				I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
				Understand I'm seeing right through
				You're hollow, you follow
				Everybody's not the real McCoy
				Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boy
				California out to Georgia, Florida then up to Illinois
				When I listen to your music I just feel annoyed
				Haters, I don't understand them
				Bred Jordan Ones from two thousand and one (OG)
				Today I think I want a Phantom
				If I don't get it I'mma throw a fucking tantrum, woah
